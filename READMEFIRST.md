Face and eye recognition and identification system with OpenCV 4.2.0.1 -python 3.8

1) Create your project folder and add /src into it 
2) Add test images into images folder
*Ignore data Folder*
3) pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-contrib-python
pip install pickle
pip install numpy

install any other necessary packages
4) Run train-faces.py in your favorite IDE python faces-train.py
 NOTE: More training data you add better your system will get trained
VERY IMPORTANT - In the venv created by python search for /lib/site-packages/cv2/data and add the entire path (from the drive as shown in faces.py) of the haarcascade.xml file use in faces.py else you will get an Assertion failed error.
 
5) Run faces.py for the result pyton faces.py
